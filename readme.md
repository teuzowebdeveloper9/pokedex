# 📘 Pokédex Project

Hey there! I know... a Pokédex isn't exactly the most original project in the dev world 😅 — but hear me out.

Creating a Pokédex is basically a **rite of passage** for us programmers (aka nerdollas™). I honestly can't imagine a dev who hasn't at least *considered* building one. Even the guy from ["O Novo Programador"](https://www.youtube.com/@ONovoProgramador) — he might not seem like it at first, but trust me, he's got **League of Legends** in his history.  
[Lucas Montano](https://www.youtube.com/@LucasMontano)? He knows how to hide it well.  
[Devyn](https://www.youtube.com/@manodeyvin)? Nerd. Absolute troll. Legend.

So yeah — I guess I'm officially part of the **Pokédex club** now too. 😔

## 🚀 About the Project

This is a simple Pokédex built with:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- And the awesome **[PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)**

The goal was to have fun while practicing my frontend skills and working with a public API.

I was genuinely impressed with how beautiful and clean it looked, so I wanted to recreate it as part of my learning.  
**All credit where credit's due. Manual do Dev, you're the GOAT. 🙌**
